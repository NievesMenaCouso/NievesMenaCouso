What kind of sorcery is this that allows people to afford houses and eat beef in a weekly basis?
Oh Gods of the Zeros and Ones, of the Inputs and Outputs and of the Bits and Chunks, 
let me be inspired by your almighty dicotomy 
and grant me access to your fleshless blessings
so my mundane existence can thrive.
